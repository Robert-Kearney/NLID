# NLID
Python tools for nonlinear identification 
This project will port the MATLAB NLID toolbox developed by Rob Kearney and colleagues into Python as an open source package. 
This toolbox includes routines for time-invariant and time-varying identification of:
1) Linear dynamic models comprising impulse response function models, frequency response function, state-space models;
2) Block oriented nonlinear structures comprising Hammerstein systems, Wiener systems, sandwich and parallel-cascade models;
3) Arbitrary nonlinear dynamic models comprising Voltera and Wiener basis expansions.
